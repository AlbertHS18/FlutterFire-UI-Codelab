# FlutterFire-UI-Codelab

This project is part of a Codelab designed to integrate a user authentication flow into a Flutter application using the **FirebaseUI** library. FirebaseUI provides ready-to-use components that simplify the implementation of authentication options like Google, Facebook, and email/password login in Flutter apps, enhancing user experience and streamlining development.

## Project Objectives

The main goal of this Codelab is to learn how to implement an authentication flow in a Flutter application quickly and efficiently. Through this project, you will:
- Configure Firebase and integrate FirebaseUI into a Flutter app.
- Implement authentication flows such as Google, Facebook, and email/password login.
- Customize the FirebaseUI authentication interface to match the appâ€™s design.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A framework for cross-platform mobile application development.
- **Firebase**: A cloud-based application development platform with backend services.
- **FirebaseUI for Flutter**: A package that facilitates the integration of preconfigured authentication options.

## Prerequisites

To work on this project, it is recommended to have basic knowledge of:
- Flutter and Dart.
- Firebase and its configuration in mobile projects.
- User authentication concepts.
